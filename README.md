# navy_encrypt

This project is pinned to **Flutter 3.3.8** and **OpenJDK 17** via
[FVM](https://fvm.app/). Using the FVM-managed binaries keeps `flutter` and
`dart` invocations consistent across macOS, Windows, and Linux environments.

```sh
# install FVM once (https://fvm.app/docs/getting_started/installation)
pub global activate fvm

# run Flutter and Dart through FVM for every command
fvm flutter pub get
fvm flutter test
fvm dart run tool/some_script.dart
```

After `fvm install`, the desired SDK version is cached under `.fvm/flutter_sdk`
and ignored from version control. Developers can still use the globally
installed Flutter CLI, but the recommended workflow is to always call `fvm
flutter …` or `fvm dart …`.

## Building release artifacts

Refer to [docs/build_artifacts.md](docs/build_artifacts.md) for step-by-step
instructions on producing signed Android APK/AAB packages and iOS IPA archives,
including how to retrieve the artifacts generated by CI. The short version is:

```sh
fvm flutter build apk --release
fvm flutter build appbundle --release
fvm flutter build ipa --release --export-method ad-hoc
```

You can also run a single Dart CLI helper that discovers the best available
Flutter binary (preferring `fvm`) and executes the requested builds:

```sh
dart run tool/build_artifacts.dart --apk --ipa --build-name 3.0.4 --build-number 8
```

The script defaults to building both an APK and IPA when no flags are supplied
and exposes toggles for app bundles, flavors, custom export methods, and
`--dart-define` values. See `dart run tool/build_artifacts.dart --help` for the
complete reference.

Building IPAs requires macOS with the Apple toolchain installed; Linux
containers used for CI cannot generate iOS archives directly.

## Manual QA

- [ ] Perform a watermark-only run (leave encryption disabled, apply a watermark), then use the share action on the result screen and confirm the shared file includes the new watermark rather than the original asset.

## Encryption QA

- [ ] Encrypt the same source file twice with the same password and confirm the resulting `.enc` files differ in size or content (random IVs ensure uniqueness while both decrypt back to the original file).
- [ ] Decrypt an older `.enc` file created before the random-IV update to confirm legacy payloads without IV metadata are still readable.
